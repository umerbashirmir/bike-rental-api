#  Project Architecture â€“ Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This architecture shows the end-to-end flow of the project from user input to model prediction and response.

---

##  Components

1. Client (Postman / Python Script / User)
   - Sends a POST request to the API
   - Includes input data (11 features like temp, atemp, hum, etc.)

2. Flask API (Deployed on Render)
   - Receives the request at the /predict endpoint
   - Extracts the data and converts it into a NumPy array
   - Loads the trained model (bike_rental_model.pkl)
   - Sends the array to the model for prediction

3. Machine Learning Model
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Trained using historical bike rental data
   - Returns the predicted rental count as output

4. Response (Returned to Client)
   - JSON response with "prediction": value
   - Sent back to Postman or Python script
