#  Bike Rental Demand Prediction API

This project builds a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand based on historical data. The best-performing model was deployed using a Flask API that accepts input features and returns a predicted bike count.

---

##  Workflow Overview

###  1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset from CSV
- Checked for null values and data types
- Feature selection and encoding

###  2. Model Training
- Trained two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Compared performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R¬≤ Score

###  3. Model Evaluation
- Random Forest performed best and was saved using joblib
- Model file: bike_rental_model.pkl

###  4. Flask API Setup
- API built using Flask in VS Code
- Two endpoints:
  - / ‚Äì base route to confirm the API is live
  - /predict ‚Äì accepts POST request with input features and returns predicted rental count

###  5. API Testing
- Tested locally using Postman
- Verified successful JSON predictions
