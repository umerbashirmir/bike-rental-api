 OBJECTIVE:
To build and deploy a machine learning model that predicts daily bike rental demand based on calendar and weather data. The project includes end-to-end training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask API.

---

 TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES:
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Render (deployment)
- GitHub
- Postman (testing)

---

 DATASET:
- Source: CSV file with historical bike rental records
- Features: Season, year, month, holiday, workingday, weather, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed
- Target: Count of bike rentals

---

 PROCESS:

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Checked for nulls
   - Feature selection & encoding
   - Scaling as needed

2. Model Building
   - Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluated with MSE, RMSE, and R² Score
   - Saved the best model (Random Forest) using joblib

3. API Development
   - Created Flask app with / and /predict endpoints
   - Used JSON input and returned prediction as JSON response

4. Deployment
   - Pushed project to GitHub
   - Deployed Flask app on Render
   - Bound to port 5000 and 0.0.0.0 for production access

5. Testing
   - Tested API using Postman and Python requests
   - Verified predictions return successfully
